# dotfiles
Common location to store all of my dotfiles. Feel free to use, but make sure to change the username and email in the gitconfig file.

# TODO after install
* Put Github email back into the gitconfig file

# How to use
Two options:
* Option 1: Clone into local directory and run the install.sh bash file which will move the files into your home directory. This option will preserve files that already exist by adding '.backup' onto the end of the existing file as well as a timestamp.
* Option 2: Clone into local directory and manually move the dotfiles into the correct location. This option is useful if you want to move the dotfiles into a location that is not your home directory.
